Among participants exposed to the pooled political misinformation, there was a significant effect of correction format on political beliefs, as well, F(2, 674) = 10.35, p < .0001. Planned contrasts revealed that both the context only (M = 3.05, SD = 0.65) and context with ratings (M = 3.14, SD = 0.70) correction formats were equally successful at correcting beliefs compared with those receiving no correction (M = 2.81, SD = 0.72). The effectiveness of the correction was higher for those who have the same-party affiliation as the candidate (i.e., those predisposed to react with distrust toward the correction) and those who have the opposing affiliation (predisposed to believe the correction)."
